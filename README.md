# Space-Blog-Webpage
Space Blog website with a working homepage and a blog post. I am having issues with laying out my grid boxes. On my homepage the header goes to the right only when it is supposed to be at the top and my footer doesn't completely stick to the bottom. On my blog page, the 'about' class, 'archives' class and the 'social media' class don't stay in the right place.
